Methods: Vulnerability Layer - Notes

Extracted the independent layer of age group 0-5 yrs, 65-74 years and over 75 years from Dresden Open Data Portal. https://opendata.dresden.de/informationsportal/#app/mainpage/Bev%C3%B6lkerung///

Extracted schools, kindergarten and nursing homes from OSM Geofabrik Sachsen http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany/sachsen.html via feature select.

Clipped the OSM Datasets to the extend of the Dresden Open Data Portal age groups extend.

Graduated the different percentages of the age group layers in seven classes with Natural Breaks (Jenks) as mode. PROBLEM: The classes are all colored the same but the percentages are different. **This might be a problem when combining the layers = every percentage should have the same coloring**.

Merged the three age group layers using: ***merge vector layers***. All attributes persist, the merged layer was graduated and colored with the same amount of classes and mode as the original layers. This enabled the comparison between all layers and the merged layer was different than the original ones albeit closest to the over 75 years age group. This is because this age group has the lowest and the highest percentages which have been reflected in the merged layer. **THIS MIGHT BE A METHODICAL PROBLEM**, different solution?

Buffered the three OSM data sets school, kindergarten and nursing home with a 200m buffer, than merged them again using: ***merge vector layers***. 

Now the two layers have to be combined, but how?

For the buffered OSM layer an interpolation could work, so that starting from this buffer core layer, where the highest risk is, concentric circles radiate outward and the risk gradually decreases. But interpolation is a raster comand (I guess) and therefore this vector layer must first become a raster, or maybe this is done during the interpolation process (see the former uhi group methods). Also, because the buffer circles do not have a value, it must first be provided. If the interpolation worked out, this raster layer can then be clipped to the extend of the age group layer aka the city extend. But then, the age group and the interpolated buffer layer still have to be combined. For this, it might be good, if the values of the interpolated buffer layer is in the range of the percentages of the age group layer, so that the inner buffer circle represents the highest percentage (and thereby the highest risk) of the age group layer. Anyways, those number are only relative and not absolute. Another approach would be looking up research papers and see, how they solved that problem or weighted the layers. This though, might take some time and again, since the values are only relative anyways, this step can be skipped. For combining the layers, further thoughts should be spend on the weighting of the two layers. Should they be equal i. e. 50:50 or s one layer more important aka represents risk better than the other?



**<u>Test calculation using polygon layer nursing_homes</u>**

<u>Interpolation method:</u> created centroid points using the command ***centroids*** and adding to this new point layer a new field called *value* (make sure its attribute type is integer number ) and give every feature the number 10. Then buffer the centroids with 1km, 5km and 10km radius. Dissolve the buffered circles into one polygon using ***dissolve*** and then use the command ***vertices*** to generate a point layer out of the boundaries of the polygon layer. Alter the numbers of the field *value* for 1km to 9, for 5km to 5 and for 10 km to 1.Merge now all four point layers (centroid, 1km, 5km and 10 km). Interpolate the existing merged point layer with the TIN interpolation (IDW interpolation didnt look as convincing). The interpolation attribute is *value*, the extend is such, that all the points are within, pixel size is 100. At the end, clip the resulting tin raster to the extend of the age group district shapefile using the command *clip raster by mask layer*. Interpolation done. **TO DO: write a batch file, so that i dont need to click so many things in QGIS.**

<u>Counting method:</u> Idea: count all the polygons (school, kidergarten, nursing home) inside the districts. The districts with many of those polygons are more vulnerable. Write a batch for this, because counting it manually is not scientific and replicable enough. 

Idea: convert the building polygons into centroid point layer and the use ***count points in polygon***. Worked out. Preprocessing: merge buildings and compute the centroids of each polygon. Maybe still write a batch file.





Methods: Heat Layer

Create a point vector layer by making points on the qgis canvas roughly where the weather stations are. Then add the csv with the meteorological data in and add it to the different points of the weather stations.
