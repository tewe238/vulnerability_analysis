**Vulnerability Layer**
To combine the (1) age groups, use the model: Model_combining_age_groups.model3

To get the (2.1) OSM data interpolation results, first the model: Model_preprocessing_interpolation.model3 has to be run, and after that the model: model_tin_interpolation.model3.

For the (2.2) OSM data counting method, the model: model_counting_points_in_polygons.model3 is needed.

To combine the (3.1) age groups (1) with the interpolation (2.1) result, the model: 
model_zonal_statistics2.model3 has to be run.

To combine teh (3.2) age groups (1) with the counting method (2.2), the model: model_join_agegroups_and_countingpoints.model3 is needed.

**Temperature Layer**
To obtain the LST from the satelite data, the model: model_slim_lst-30_clip.model3 has to be run.

**Heat Risk Layer**
For combining the vulnerability with th etemperature layer, the model: model_zonal_statistics2.model3 is used again.
